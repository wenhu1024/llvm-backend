This example introduces the FileCheck keywords.
The keywords are appended to the check prefix with -<keyword>.

In this example you can see a few keywords in action:
- SAME: match on the same line
- DAG: match order does not matter between different DAG directives
- NEXT: match exactly on the next line
- NOT: make sure this pattern is not match
